## Joy

Since I wrote my bachelor thesis in Quarto one of the aspects I really liked was that I had everything at one place. Different outputs, code and text together.

## Challenge

Getting feedback from my supervisor was not as straight forward. I had to render my thesis into a docx file and then add it to the google drive where she would be able to add comments and fix stuff. I always had to manually type in the changes in my qmd-file instead of just clicking on a button like except.

## Fact to learn

Where can AI or LLM help me in the development of my working process.
