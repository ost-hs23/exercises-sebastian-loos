1.  Create a 2 row x 2 column table, populate with a column for restaurant + column for cuisine. Then, cross reference it from text.

    | restaurant | cuisine  |
    |------------|----------|
    | dieci      | italian  |
    | Le Cedre   | lebanese |

    : Restaurants in Zürich {#tbl-restaurants}

    @tbl-restaurants includes a list of restaurants in Zürich and it's corresponding type of cuisine.

2.  Include the Quarto logo from the `images/` folder as a figure. Add a caption, id, and cross-reference to the figure.

    <div>

    ![Logo of Quarto](images/quarto-logo.png){#fig-quarto}

    </div>

    The logo of quarto is displayed in @fig-quarto.

3.  **Stretch goal:** Add a caption, label, and cross-reference to the figure generated from the code below.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: Scatterplot about the relationship between bill depth and length for three diffeent penguin species.
#| label: fig-bill-point
#| warning: false
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-asp: 0.618

ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                     y = bill_depth_mm,
                     color = species,
                     shape = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_colorblind() +
  labs(x = "Bill length (mm)", y = "Bill depth (mm)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

@fig-bill-point shows the relationship between the bill length and depth of three different penguin species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo).
